The next clue tells Melissa to start the day with a snack at the Italian deli that originated the famous muffaletta sandwich. She needs to find the deli, Central Grocery, and check in on Swarm. Once she's done this, the next clue is unlocked.

Once at the Central Grocery, the next clue instructs her to make sure to get some Zapp's potato chips, specifically the "Voodoo" flavor chips. In the rack of potato chips, she finds a voodoo doll with another puzzle piece clue pinned to it with the word "Voodoo" on it.
